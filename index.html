      <p>I have been soul-searching for a while now, trying to decide what direction to take my career in. I am a passionate person, and I've learned that I create the my most meaningful work when it is infused with challenges and context that are truly and deeply stimulating to me. When I stumbled upon Startup Institute, it immediately seemed like the perfect fit for my interests, both culturally and educationally. I am eager to see what new <emp>inspiration</emp> this summer will bring! </p>
